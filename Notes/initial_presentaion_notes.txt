// Initial Presentation Notes

1. Problem Definition
- Draft a statement of the problem:
- Current system needs scaling.
- Potential issues may arise that are not yet visible.
- Identify pain points (performance bottlenecks, time complexity, limited flexibility).

2. Requirements Gathering
- Decide which tables belong in MongoDB and which remain in SQL.
- Document the purpose of moving each dataset:
- Example: Unstructured data → MongoDB, transactional data → SQL.
- Define features to be added and how they solve existing issues.

3. System Design
- Prepare design artifacts:
- ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) for SQL.
- JSON schema for MongoDB collections.
- Show hybrid architecture:
- How MySQL and MongoDB will work together in one process.
- Specify tech stack (Node.js + other frameworks, libraries, drivers).
- Identify database driver used for integration.

4. Data Integration & Processes
- Define inter-process communication between MongoDB and SQL.
- Show data separation rules (what belongs where).
- Ensure ACID compliance for SQL transactions.
- Plan rollback and logging mechanisms:
- Failed attempts must be recorded.
- Rollback attempts should be logged.
- Logs must be separated (internal vs. external).

5. Logging & Analytics
- External logs: customer/rider-facing (parcel status updates).
- Internal logs: system tracking, rollback attempts.
- Analytics logs:
- Products added to cart.
- Returns (with cause: manufacturer issue, customer damage, etc.).
- Page visits and category tracking.

6. Feature Implementation
- Implement proposed features:
- Hybrid database operations (both SQL and MongoDB active).
- Scalability improvements (time complexity reduction, convenience).
- Logging system with separation of internal/external views.

7. Testing
- Produce test data for the new version of the system.

8. Additional Info
- Final project = 40% of grade final grade/20% of everall grade.
- Activities = 60% of final grades.
- Midterm & Final = 50 50.
- Make a submission folder (green).

GROUP 1
Post Presentation feedback for group 1:
-Show a problem statemen(?)
**-**Show diagrams of your system architecture

GROUP 3
During Presentation Notes:
-Showed technical architeture diagram
-Questioned about the fact that they only have one category of logs (perhaps logs segragated in categories would help)
-Mention distinct problems that come with your system architecture followed with the solution to the problem
-There should be a history log of everything including failed operation attempts.
-They showed what each "user" of the system will see
